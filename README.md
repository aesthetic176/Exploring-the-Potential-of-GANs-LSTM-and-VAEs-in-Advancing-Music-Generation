# Music Generation Using AI

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our innovative project on AI-driven music generation! Our team has embarked on an exciting journey to explore the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in the realm of music creation.

## Project Overview
This project delves into the fascinating world of computer-generated music. We aim to push the boundaries of how music is composed and experienced in the digital era. Our focus has been on evaluating and understanding the unique qualities that GANs, LSTMs, and VAEs bring to music generation.

### Key Features
- **GANs**: Creating novel melodies and rhythms by simulating a creative collaboration between dual neural networks.
- **LSTMs**: Utilizing memory reservoirs to preserve the essence of musical compositions, aiding in the generation of new harmonious pieces.
- **VAEs**: Expertly blending song fragments to create new and melodic compositions.

## Dataset
We've used the GTZAN Dataset for music genre classification. This dataset is a comprehensive collection covering multiple music genres, providing a rich resource for our analyses.

## Methodology
Our approach involves a detailed examination of each AI model:
- **GANs** for their creative and collaborative music generation capabilities.
- **LSTMs** for their strength in sequential data processing and pattern recognition in music.
- **VAEs** for their ability to generate diverse and realistic music outputs.

## Results
We've successfully generated music using these AI models, analyzing the quality, noise levels, and coherence of the generated music. Our findings highlight the importance of algorithm selection based on quality and noise requirements in music creation.

## Contributions
This repository is a testament to our commitment to advancing the field of AI in music. We welcome collaborators, musicians, and AI enthusiasts to explore, contribute, and help us in refining these technologies for music generation.

Join us in this exciting venture into the future of music! ðŸŽ¶
